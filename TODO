Download ctools, gnumake, etc... in order to build a complete PureDarwin sdk.
Afterwards try to make libfirehose and other headers, then install them into PureDarwinSDK.
If done right, we won't need to look into the host OS.

Oh, and reinstate the pdsdk variable that points to puredarwinsdk.
If booted into PureDarwin, pdbuild expects it in /Library/Developer/PureDarwinSDK. Implement that!
If on macOS, pdsdk should be specified in an environment variable.

Print the pre-build output like darwinbuild did.
Consider using xcpretty to make the build output look neater
Maybe silence the build output, then create a setting/switch to print build info or not.
