Since the sources have changed drastically since OSX 10.8/9 (which I think was the last
darwinbuld-supported distro). We have to manually figure out the dependencies and manually
add them into the build plist. However, due to the weird self-include dependencies, we have
to add an "xcodeBuildSettings" property to include directories in project x. For example, pthread
includes its own header files with angle brackets, but those headers aren't installed in the Destination Root,
nor are their directories specified in the build settings.
Therefore, we add HEADER_SEARCH_PATH ==> "$(SRCROOT)/includedir_X" to the "xcodeBuildSettings" dictionary property.
We can also modify any broken settings with this property without having to hardcode them into pdbuild.
