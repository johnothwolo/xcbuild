Added new option for xcodebuild projects, called "xcodeBuildSettings". This appends user-specified build settings.

We know what type a project is from the "productBundleType" property, which matches "CFBundlePackageType" build property
This allows us to specify include paths in the right order, so that the kexts build.
However, this is only possible if and only if the "target" plist property is specified.
We can't really modify xcodeBuildSettings for every target in an "all" build.
Default include paths for kexts in pdbuild are system.famework and kernel.frameowrk
